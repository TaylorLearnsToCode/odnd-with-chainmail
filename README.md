# odnd-with-chainmail
Foundry VTT System to support 0e with Chainmail

A version 0.9 compatible, bare-bones implementation of 0e: including Chainmail as the combat resolution system.
LBBs only - no macros (for now).

This project saw me learning the Foundry API and Handlebars.js in the same swoop - and thus, I will not apologize 
that the code is completely jankity!

Planning on adding more and improving as time goes on.
Thanks for reading!
